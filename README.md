# PiNav-Dissertation
This repository contains a copy of my Dissertation and my Python code. 
The Python code continuously measures distance through ultrasonic sensors and displays an interactive GUI. 
PiNav is a Parking Sensor System using a Raspberry Pi 3. It uses ultrasonic sensors for distance measurement and also implements an
interactive GUI to display the distance measurement.
